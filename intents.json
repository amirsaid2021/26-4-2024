          "Camels have numerous adaptations for desert life, including thick fur to protect against the sun, specialized hooves for walking on sand, and the ability to conserve water by reabsorbing moisture from their urine.",
          "The life cycle of a butterfly consists of four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). This process is called metamorphosis.",
          "Dolphins communicate using a combination of vocalizations, body language, and echolocation, which involves emitting high-frequency clicks and interpreting the echoes.",
